This is an Angular 21 project. Always use signals and effects for reactive state. Use modern TypeScript with async/await.

Use modern Angular control flow syntax: `@if` instead of `*ngIf`, `@for` instead of `*ngFor`, and `@let` instead of `*ngLet`.

Use `inject()` for dependency injection instead of constructor injection. All components must be standalone (no NgModules).
